                <b>Self-Directed Learning </b>
            </div>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 21st century has brought unprecedented change in all spheres of our lives, 
                creating a need for continuous learning and re-learning. It is now essential that learners be 
                given an opportunity to develop a broader repertoire of skills, attitudes, and approaches in 
                their formal educational experiences to prepare them for lifelong learning. <p>

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gaining competence in the traditional school subjects is 
                no longer enough; there is now an urgent need to develop and practice skills such as problem-solving, critical thinking, 
                resource identification, as well as attributes such as curiosity, initiative, and acceptance of 
                responsibility for one's own learning. All of these skills and attributes are incorporated in the 
                characteristics of a highly self-directed learner. <p>


                <b>The Critical Role of the Learning Facilitator</b><br>

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty-first century learners will need to become highly self-directed learners – 
                equipped to effectively continue to address their learning needs throughout their lives. The 
                role of the teacher as facilitator in designing and using instructional strategies which enable 
                students effectively to direct their own learning is essential in enhancing Self-Directed 
                Learning (SDL). Teachers, professors, and teacher trainers need to become learning 
                facilitators, moving away from classroom approaches in which their students are merely 
                passive recipients of the knowledge of others.<p>

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The traditional lecture reinforces the view that learning means absorbing information 
                and repeating it, while it has been shown that having students take a more active part in the 
                learning process is a much more effective teaching strategy. If we can successfully 
                strengthen the SDL propensities and abilities of students, specifically in teacher education, 
                these prospective teachers will be better prepared to be lifelong, self-directed learners and 
                also more able to equip students with these skills at school level.<p>
